      <description>A personal website to showcase personal projects is one of the most important things a computer science student should have when they are searching for a job. This tutorial will serve all those students that are not well-versed in web development and want an easy way to set up their website in a fast manner.
Before Starting With this tutorial I&amp;rsquo;m assuming you have an IDE such as VS Code or Sublime and a version control system such as Git.</description>

      <description>Personal Website The website you are looking at right now was created for the purpose of showing my personal projects and write guides on things that I find interesting. A cool little feature the website has is the button you see in the upper-right corner which changes the website from dark-mode to light-mode and viceversa. Please take a look around and contact me if you have any questions.
Technologies: Hugo, JavaScript, HTML/CSS</description>
